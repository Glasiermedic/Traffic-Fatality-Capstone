National Motor Vehicle Accident Fatality 2017
The National Traffic Safety Administration has setup Fatality Analysis Reporting (FARS) which collects fatal motor vehicle accidents data. The primary contributors to the database are law enforcement agencies and state agencies across the nation. This data set is interesting because it combines a wide variety of variables around motor vehicle accidents including the detailed location and time of the accident, multiple contributing factors to the accident and multiple weather and lighting factors. For the intent of this capstone project we are focusing on the states, time of year, day in the month, day of the week, the time of the day, number of vehicles and the number of fatalities.
We can use this data to help answer important questions about traffic accident deaths and ways to avoid them. For instance is there a specific time that is more dangerous? Can we predict that as more motor vehicles are involved the greater chance of a fatality? For each season what are the states with the highest fatalities?
